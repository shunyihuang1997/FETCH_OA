# Observations
1). we can see that female user prefer using facebook to sign up, whereas other user prefer Apple.<br />
<br />
2). Andriod users are more than other platform. <br />
<br />
3). Most user at adulthood category prefer using Apple to sign up, whereas user at middle adulthood prefer Facebook. <br />
<br />
4). From the pie chart and the other plot, we could say that users at adulthood and middle adulthood are much more than other other age group. <br />
<br />


# Future Step
1). User demographics and purchase behavior (eg. explore the relationship between user demographics (such as age, gender, and location) and their purchase behavior (such as total amount spent, number of items purchased, and whether they earn rewards)  <br />
2). Brand performance: We could analyze sales data by brand to see which brands are most popular and profitable. We could also look at the relationship between brand and customer loyalty (e.g., do customers who purchase a certain brand tend to return to purchase it again?). <br />
3). Receipt item analysis: We could analyze the purchase data at a more granular level by looking at individual receipt items. This could help we identify which products are most frequently purchased and which products tend to be purchased together. <br />
4). Time-based analysis: We could look at trends over time, such as changes in sales by month or year. We could also analyze customer behavior over time, such as whether they tend to make purchases at certain times of day or year. <br />
